**For you to do:**

Create two interfaces 
1. MyFirstInterface - which has un-implemented method  firstMethod()
2. MySecondInterface - which has un-implemented method  secondMethod()

Now, write a class which will implement both the interfaces and print the below output

**Output:**

```
First Method implementing multiple Inheritance
Second Method implementing multiple Inheritance
```
