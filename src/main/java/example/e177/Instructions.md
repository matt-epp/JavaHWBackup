**For you to do:**

Create two interfaces

1. iOutputs - which has un-implemented method  display(double myResult)
2. iFunctions  - which has un-implemented method  
   double adding(double firstNumber , double secondNumber);
   double subtracting(double firstNumber , double secondNumber);
   double multiply(double firstNumber , double secondNumber);
   double dividing(double firstNumber , double secondNumber);

   and also iFunctions inherits iOutputs


Now, write a class which will implement  the iFunctions and print the below output

Note : display () method is utilized to print the result 

**Output:**

```
Result is ::: 120.0
Result is ::: 80.0
Result is ::: 2000.0
Result is ::: 5.0
```
