**For you to do:**

Write a program using the switch statement

Let us consider the scenario regarding the born baby age

```
First Output: "Enter the age of the Child"
```

```
case 1: if age is 1 print as "You can Crawl"
```

```
case 2 : if age is 2 print as  "You can Talk"
```

```
case 3: If age is 3 print as "You can Dance"
```

```
case 4: if age is 4 print as "You can get Trouble"
```

```
Other than this age (1-4) it should print "I don't know how old you are" 
```
