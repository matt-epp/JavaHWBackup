Ask the user to enter any number

if a user enters a number and it is even, print "Value is even", 
after that it should check if the number is greater than 1000 it should also print 
even number is large otherwise even value is just right. if number is not even it should
print number is odd after that it should check if odd number is greater than 1000 it should 
say odd value is large otherwise odd value is just right
