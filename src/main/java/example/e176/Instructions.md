**For you to do:**

Create two interfaces

1. ParentInterface - which has un-implemented method  parentMethod()
2. ChildInterface - which has un-implemented method  childMethod ()
   and also ChildInterface inherits the ParentInterface


Now, write a class which will implement  the ChildInterface and print the below output

**Output:**

```
Parent Method-welcome to Syntax
Child Method-hello Syntax
```
