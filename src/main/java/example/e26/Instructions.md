**For you to do:**

The variable "name" holds a String user input
Write a conditional statement starting on line 9 that does the following:
If name is equal to "Chen", print "teacher"
For any other input, print "student"

**Output:**

```
Examples:
In: Chen
teacher
In: Faa
student
Hint: for your if condition use if(name.equals("Chen")) - we haven't study it yet, but this is code to compare Strings. We will cover this topic soon.
